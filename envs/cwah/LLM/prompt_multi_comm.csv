Response format:
    {{""thoughts"" : ""thoughts content"", # think about the necessity of sending a message, as there are costs to send messages.
        ""receiver"" : list of receiver's name or [""everyone""] if you want to broadcast the message, 
        ""message"" : list of message contents for each receiver # if the messages are the same for all receivers, you can just send one message.

Note: You must respond in the json format above with ""{{}}"". If there is no new information, you do not need to send a message, please fill in ""receiver"" and ""message"" as a string ""None"". As [walktowards] actions may take several steps to finish, you do not have new observations and do not need to make new decisions during [walktowards] actions. You can first concentrate on the current round of dialogue, and reply to the queries if necessary. Refer to the previous rounds of dialogue and do not repeat the similar dialogues. You do not have to be too polite so that we can save communication costs."
